Abstract: 
The idea was to create a chess AI based on evaluations from existing chess engines. If successful this would be much easier than trying to teach the AI how to play chess from the very beginning. The AI just tries to find the correct evaluation for a given position and makes the move that leads to the best highest evaluation.

The first step was to find a good dataset that contains chess positions and the corresponding evaluations by the best modern chess engines. The best one I found was from this source: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1smI2B7kiwzkr43TqnCYOpxocZlI0kPUh, it contains a large number of games played on the open source chess platform lichess.org. The dataset had a lot of information about the chess positions like usernames, rating and so on. But the only thing interesting to us was the FEN and evaluation of the position. FEN´s are a kind of encoding for a chess position. Using pythons library python-chess it was possible to extract the positions from the FEN´s. 

The idea was now to create some kind of representation of these positions that a neural network can understand. Then it would be possible to feed the positions and the evaluations to the neural network and to train it on them. This would then hopefully lead to the neural network beeing able to predict the evaluations for positions it has not seen before. The problem with this might be that a chess positions is very complex and small changes can influece the evaluation by a lot. 

For the task I chose a Convolutional Neural Network. A chessboard would then be looked at as if it was an image with 8x8 pixels. To add more information to the "images" I chose to represent the chessboard as a 8x8x12 image, with every layer containing the information about one specific piece of one color. For example the first layer has a 1 everywhere where a white pawn stands and the rest of the pixels is 0. This data is then given to the neural network. I tried many different configurations for the neural network, having 2-5 convolutional layers, 1-3 fully connected layers in the end, padding and no padding, stride 1 or 2 and so on. For the prediction I tried different ways to represent the score. Having negarive and positive scores, only positive scores and even changing the whole network to predict classes instead of scores. That means there is a class for "White is winning", "White is better", "Equal", "Black is better" and "Black is winning". The issue with all there approaches was that the network returned the same result for any input I gave to it. Also some of the layers of the network always return tensors with only zeroes. That means the network doesn´t save any information about the input
